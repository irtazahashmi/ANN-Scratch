A grocery-robot has no knowledge of what kind of product an apple is. However, it can determine the features of a product using its sensors. 
Based on features like the shape, color, weight and wrapping of a product, it can recognize specific classes. The problem can be simplified into 
classification, which can be performed by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Based on the value of these features, the ANN could then categorize 
the product into various classes. My team and I wrote a fully functioning neural network **from scratch**: a feed-forward neural network with a back-propagation 
training algorithm. We also have to write a report explaining what we did (Group_40_report.pdf). We created a network that can classify an input of 
10 features into one of 7 classes. 

We loaded the data, divided it into training sets and used it to train our neural network. Finally, we used our network to recognize the classes of the 
unknown sample. The entire network was written from scratch. Jupyter Notebook can efficiently create and train neural networks using libraries. 
We compared our neural network's results with neural network libraries to see how well does our network perform.
